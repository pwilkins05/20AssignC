Tag is a game where there are at least 2 players. One person is "It" and the person who is "It" has to run and catch the other player.
Once the other player is caught the person who is "It" must lightly tap the other player and yell "You're it!" thus making the other player the pursuer.
The game is over when one of the players gives up, thus making the other more resiliant player the winner.
